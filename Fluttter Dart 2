Question no #1
Create two integer variables length and breadth and assign values then check if they are square values or rectangle values.
i.e: if both values are equal then it's square otherwise rectangle.
void main(){
  int length = 45;
  int breath = 55;
  if (length == breath){
    print ("square");
  }
  else{
    print ("rectangle");
  }
}



Question no # 2
Take two variables and store age then using if/else condition to determine oldest and youngest among them.
void main() {
  int age1 = 55;
  int age2 =65;
   if(age1<age2){
     print ("first one is younger");
   }
  else if (age1==age2){
    print ("both age is same ");
  }
  else{
    print ("second is younger");
  }
}


Question no # 3
 A student will not be allowed to sit in exam if his/her attendance is less than 75%. Create integer variables and assign value:
Number of classes held = 16,
Number of classes attended = 10,
and print percentage of class attended.
Is student is allowed to sit in exam or not?

void main(){
  int classes = 16;
  int attended = 10;
  double percentage = attended/classes*100;
  print ("percentage of class attended ;$percentage");
  if (percentage<75){
    print ("Not Allowed");
  }
  else{
    print ("Allowed");
  }
  
}
 
Question no # 4 
Create integer variable assign any year to it and check if a year is leap year or not.
If a year is divisible by 4 then it is leap year but if the year is century year like 2000, 1900, 2100 then it must be divisible by 400.
i.e: Use % ( modulus ) operator?

void main() {
  int year = 2020;
  double check = year%4;
  if (check ==0){
    print ("leap year");
  }
  else{
  print ("not leap year");
}
  }

Question no # 5 
 Write a program to read temperature in centigrade and display a suitable message according to temperature:
You have num variable temperature = 42;
Now print the message according to temperature:
temp < 0 then Freezing weather
temp 0-10 then Very Cold weather
temp 10-20 then Cold weather
temp 20-30 then Normal in Temp
temp 30-40 then Its Hot
temp >=40 then Its Very Hot ?

void main (){
 var int = 25;
  var tempreture = 42;
 (" print tempreture = 25");
 num temp = (0 + 42);
  ("print freezing whether");
  int  = (0-10);
  ("print  very cold whether");
  int = (10-20);
  ("print cold whether");
  int =(20-30);
  ("print normal temp");
int =(30-40);
  ("print Hot temp");
  int = (40);
  ("print very Hot"); 
}
 

Question no # 6
Write a program to check whether an alphabet is a vowel or consonant.

void main (){
  string alphabat = "u";
  if (alphabat=="a"||alphabat == "e"|| alphabat=="i"|| alphabat =="o" || alphabat == "u"){
    print ("alphabat is a vowel");
  }
  else{
    print("Alphabat is a consonant");
  }
  } 


  
Question no # 7
Write a program to calculate and print the Electricity bill of a given customer. Create variable for customer id,
name, unit consumed by the user, bill_amount and print the total amount the customer needs to pay. The charge are as follow :

Unit    Charge/unit
upto 199    @1.20
200 and above but less than 400    @1.50
400 and above but less than 600    @1.80
600 and above             @2.00;

Test Data :
id: 1001
name: James
units: 800
Expected Output :
Customer IDNO :1001
Customer Name :James
unit Consumed :800
Amount Charges @Rs. 2.00 per unit : 1600.00
Net Bill Amount : 1600.00


void main (){
  int bill  = 3000;
  ("print bill is 3000");
  
  var id =4444;
  ("print id is 4444");
  
  var name  = ("john");
  ("print name is john");
  
  var unit = 700;
  ("print unit is 700");
  
  var charge = 1600;
  ("print charge amount is @Rs 2.00 per unit");
  
  var total  = 8000;
  ("print total that can pay constomer is 8000");
   
}
